Description: OpenSMTPD filter integration for the Rspamd daemon
 filter-rspamdDescription This filter implements the Rspamd protocol and
 allows OpenSMTPD to request an Rspamd analysis of an SMTP transaction
 before a message is committed to queue.  Features The filter currently
 supports: • greylisting• adding X-Spam related headers to a
 message• rewriting Subject• DKIM-signing message• Rspamd-provided
 SMTP replies• Allow Rspamd to add and remove headersDependencies The
 filter is written in Golang and doesn't have any dependencies beyond
 standard library.
 .
 It requires OpenSMTPD 6.6.0 or higher.  How to install Install from your
 operating system's preferred package manager if available.  On OpenBSD:
 .
 $ doas pkg_add opensmtpd-filter-rspamd quirks-3.167 signed on
 2019-08-11T14:18:58Z opensmtpd-filter-rspamd-0.1.x: ok $
 .
 .
 Alternatively, clone the repository, build and install the filter:
 .
 $ cd filter-rspamd/ $ go build $ doas install -m 0555 filter-rspamd
 /usr/local/libexec/smtpd/filter-rspamd
 .
 How to configure The filter itself requires no configuration.
 .
 It must be declared in smtpd.conf and attached to a listener for sessions
 to go through rspamd: ``` filter "rspamd" proc-exec "filter-rspamd"
 .
 listen on all filter "rspamd" ```
 .
 A remote rspamd instance can be specified by providing the -url
 parameter to the filter: ``` filter "rspamd" proc-exec "filter-rspamd
 -url http://example.org:11333"
 .
 listen on all filter "rspamd" ```
 .
 Any configuration with regard to thresholds or enabled modules must be
 done in rspamd itself.
